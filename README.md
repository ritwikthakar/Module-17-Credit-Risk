# Module-17-Credit-Risk

## Analysis Overview
In this project, we will use Python to create and assess many machine learning models to estimate credit risk.
We will adopted the following procedures:
- oversample the data using the **RandomOverSampler** and **SMOTE** algorithms.
- Undersample the data using the **ClusterCentroids** algorithm.
- Use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the **SMOTEENN** algorithm.
- Compare two machine learning models that reduce bias, **BalancedRandomForestClassifier** and **EasyEnsembleClassifier**.

We will evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
